👋 Hi, I’m Mukarram!

👨‍💻 I'm a passionate developer with a strong interest in modern web and mobile technologies.

💼 Since November 2024, I've been working at a software house, building real-world applications using both **React** and **React Native**.

🚀 I'm continuously leveling up my skills in front-end development, writing clean, maintainable code, and learning best practices from hands-on experience.

🤝 I love collaborating on innovative projects and solving real problems through code.

📫 Feel free to reach out via email at muka654r@gmail.com — I'm always open to connecting, sharing ideas, or discussing exciting opportunities!
